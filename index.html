      <p class="sec-tag text-big">WHY STUDY SUN?</p>
      <p class="sec-subtag text-small line-h">The sun is the nearest star and
        therefore can be studied in much
        more detail as compared to other
        stars. By studying the sun we can
        learn much more about stars in
        our Milky Way as well as about
        stars in various other galaxies.
        The sun is a very dynamic star
        that extends much beyond
        what we see. It shows several
        eruptive phenomena and releases
        immense amount of energy in the
        solar system. If such explosive solar
        phenomena is directed towards
        the earth, it could cause various
        types of disturbances in the near
        earth space environment.
        <span id="dots2">...</span>
        <span id="more2" style="display: none;"><br><br>Various spacecraft and
          communication systems are
          prone to such disturbances
          and therefore an early warning
          of such events is important
          for taking corrective measures
          beforehand. In addition to these,
          if an astronaut is directly exposed
          to such explosive phenomena,
          he/she would be in danger.
          The various thermal and magnetic
          phenomena on the sun are of
          extreme nature. Thus, the sun
          also provides a good natural
          laboratory to understand those
          phenomena which cannot be
          directly studied in the lab. For more information <a

        <p class="sec-tag text-big">WHAT IS LAGRANGE POINTS</p>
        <p class="sec-subtag text-small line-h ">For a two-body gravitational system, the Lagrange Points are the
          positions in space where a small object tends to stay, if put
          there. These points in space for a two-body system such as Sun
          and Earth can be used by the spacecraft to remain at these
          positions with reduced fuel consumption.
          Technically at Lagrange point, the gravitational pull of the two
          large bodies equals the necessary centripetal force required for a
          small object to move with them. For two-body gravitational
          systems, there are total five Lagrange points, denoted as
          L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5. The Lagrange point L1 lies between
          Sun-Earth line. The distance of L1 from Earth is approximately
          1% of the Earth-Sun distance.<span id="dots6">...</span>
          <span id="more6" style="display: none;"><br>L1 Point: It offers an uninterrupted view of the Sun and is
            currently occupied by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Satellite (SOHO).<br>

            L2 Point: This point has been home to spacecraft like WMAP and Planck, and it will host the James Webb Space
            Telescope in the future. L2 is ideal for astronomy because it allows for easy communication with Earth,
            solar power generation, and clear views of deep space.<br>

            L3 Point: L3 remains hidden behind the Sun at all times, making it unlikely for practical use. It has
            inspired science fiction concepts like hidden planets.<br>

            L4 and L5 Points: These points are stable orbits when the mass ratio between two large bodies exceeds 24.96.
            They are home to objects known as Trojans, including asteroids and satellites, which share orbits with
            larger bodies in the solar system. Jupiter has numerous Trojan asteroids, and some Mars and Saturn's moons
            also have Trojan companions.</span>

        <p class="sec-subtag text-small line-h ">The Aditya-L1 mission will be launched by ISRO’s PSLV XL rocket from
          Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR (SDSC-SHAR), Sriharikota.
          Initially, the spacecraft will be placed in a Low Earth Orbit. Subsequently,
          the orbit will be made more elliptical and later the spacecraft will be
          launched towards the Lagrange point (L1) by using onboard propulsion.
          As the spacecraft travels towards L1, it will exit the Earths’ gravitational
          Sphere of Influence (SOI). After exit from SOI, the cruise phase will
          start and subsequently the spacecraft will be injected into a large halo
          orbit around L1. The total travel time from launch to L1 would take about
          four months for Aditya-L1. The Trajectory of Aditya-L1 mission is

          is not only true for Aditya-L1 but
          in general for any space mission.
          The reason is that due to the
          limited mass, power and volume
          of the spacecraft that carries the
          scientific payloads in space, only
          a limited set of instruments with
          limited capacity can be sent onboard the spacecraft. In case of
          Aditya-L1, all the measurements
          will be made from the Lagrange
          point L1. As an example, the
          various phenomena of the sun are
          multi-directional and therefore the
          directional distribution of energy
          of explosive/eruptive phenomena
          will not be possible to study with
          Aditya-L1 alone.

          <span id="more7" style="display: none;"><br> Another Lagrange point known

            studying the Earth directed CME
            events and assessing the space
            weather.<br> Also, the polar regions

            of achieving spacecraft orbits
            for such studies. The sun polar
            dynamics and magnetic fields are
            believed to play important role in
            deriving the solar cycles. Further,
            the polarisation measurements
            of solar radiations at different
            wavelengths are required to
            understand the various processes
            occurring in and around the sun.
